			<source src="Clips/Dr Strange clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a big fan of the marvel cinamatic universe and I watched all of their movie in cinema, This
		scence is one of my favorite and Dr. Strange is my favorite character.</p></blockquote>

			<source src="Clips/Koe no katachi clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent voice is one of the best anime movie that I've ever watched because it tackles about the
		tradegy of being in someone's shoes while experiencing the guilt of your actions towards that someone.</p></blockquote>

		<h2>TV shows</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Adventure Time</h3>
		<video controls="controls" poster="Adventure time poster.png">
			<source src="Clips/Adventure Time clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Adventure Time has ended, It is one of the greatest TV shows that I've watched as a kid
		until I've growned up. At first, It was like your ordinary cartoon TV show with no plot but once you piece the events their is a much bigger
		lore into it.</p></blockquote>
		<br>
		<h3>Rick and Morty</h3>
		<video controls="controls" poster="Rick and Morty poster.png">
			<source src="Clips/Rick and Morty clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rick and Morty is one of those shows that is really addicting to watch and it might fool someone
		as a normal cartoon but this one  was created by adult swim which means that it is SPG, the jokes might be too much for someone but I really
		dig it.</p></blockquote>
